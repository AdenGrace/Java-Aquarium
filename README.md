# Java-Aquarium
Using Java programming language and Java's Design Patterns I've managed to code an aquarium. 
The designed artificial aquarium is made to manage a tank of sea living creatues (Fish or JellyFish based on what we choose).
Meaning, I get to choose the living creature, it's color, size and even speed! 
Within feeding the livin creature, it "Gains weight" (becomes larger in size) and it's information gets updated in the info tab where wemaintain information of all living things the the aquarium.
There's much more to my little humble tank!
Made with joy and pride, is my small aquarium. 

***Design Patterns I've Used: 
-Factoy Method. 
-Abstract Factory.
-Momento.
-Delegator.
-Decorator.
-State.
-Visitor.
-Observer.

The Aquarium has many further fun features, such as feeding the living creatures and keeping track of them all!
